    "# __Artificial Neural Networks: Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Reviews__\n",

    "[Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) is revolutionising our world as we know it. Several tasks that we thought not long ago could only be performed by humans, now can be performed by machines faster, in a bigger scale and more accurately. These tasks go from recognising recognising all the objects in millions of images to driving cars without the intervention of any human. Another huge revolution has taken place in the field of computational linguistics thanks to the [Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing). The ability to learn from the humongous corpus of texts produced by humans over centuries and recently digitised, has allowed the creation of [algorithms able to generate text](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-text-generator-gpt-3-learning-language-fitfully/) with an incredible resemblance to human texts, [translate texts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Neural_Machine_Translation) from and to multiple languages, or [virtual assistants and chatbots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant) that we can interact with by just talking to them rather than pressing buttons.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Sentiment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis), part of the NLP, is a contextual mining of text that is able to extract and quantify subjective information. Monitoring online conversations and using sentiment analysis might be useful for businesses that want to understand the social sentiment of their brand or a particular product. The increasing accessibility to online opinions in platforms such as Twitter, Amazon or Tripadvisor has made this tools to be more and more used in marketing departments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we are going to use [Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon Reviews. Basically, we will use ANN to implement an algorithm able to determine whether a text review is positive or negative. One might think that such a task seems relatively simple for humans. But, if you think for a moment, humans need years of training before are able to speak a language. And even when we do it, it is impossible for us to read and classify millions of reviews in few minutes. Machines nowadays can.\n"

    "The dataset we are going to use here is a collection of reviews and ratings on baby products purchased on Amazon.com. The reviews are all in English and consist of a piece of text that can vary in size. Ratings are the usual Amazon's 1 to 5 stars. This dataset is part of a Kaggle challenge available at [this page](https://www.kaggle.com/shyann/amazon-baby-reviews-basics). The format of the data is in a CSV file, which is quite convenient to treat using a `pandas` data frame. Let's first load the dataset and do some exploration."

These kind of effects are quite normal when analysing real data, and we should be aware of it before making any assumptions. This also provides useful information for setting a baseline model. For example, we know that if our null model predicted a rating of 5 without regardless of review text, we would be correct 58.33% of the time, which is quite a lot. Thus, any machine learning model that is really working should beat that percentage."

    "As you can observe the texts we obtain are all different in terms of lengths, rating values and even the writing style, words used, etc. However, we can expect some common words to appear in the reviews. Words such as \"like\", \"love\" and \"I\" generally appear quite often in the text reviews and particularly in these three. The word \"stickers\" is another one that appears in all three examples, which makes sense considering the product we selected is actually a sticker calendar. We can also expect that the appearance of some kind of words is going to be linked with a positive sentiment, whereas other kind of words are going to be related with negative sentiment. A common technique in NLP it is literally based on that; defining a set of words and count how many times and in which order they appear.\n",

    "The `keras` library for Python has a preprocessing text suit of tools that are specifically design for those tasks. One of the most popular open-source software for deep learning is [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), developed and widely used by Google. It is quite complicated to learn programming in TensorFlow from scratch, so the `keras` simplifies our lives substantially by providing standard models and machine learning tools that we can use as functions. I basically acts as the intermediate layer between Python and TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The object we want to use here is called `Tokenizer`. For a given piece of text, the `Tokenizer` will preprocess the text doing several operations. First, will delete any special character indicated in `filters`. Then will convert all capital letters to correspoinding lower case if the argument `lower=True`. Finally it will split the text in a list of words by the character we indicate in `split`, which is usually a space. Once the text it is split word by word, we can easily obtain `sequences` containing lists of numbers matching the words we manually defined in  the dictionary `work_index`. In these lists of numbers encode the appearance and order of the selected words in the different pieces of text."

This indicates that the words \"stickers\" and \"i\" - remember everything is converted to lower case first - appear in this particular order in the first review. You can check it out in the examples above. The second list is longer because contains many more occurrences of our 4-word dictionary, including repetitions.

    "Again, we see the same kind of unbalance toward the positive sentiment. In fact, this something expected and encouraging, because it means that the collection of words used might be a good representation of the reviews. However, there are some nuances to consider. Remember that the tokenizer first splits the reviews into separated words. If there is a review saying \"I really don't like it.\", the word \"like\" appears in it even though the review is clearly negative. This word, as many others, can actually represent both opinions. Then, how do we know it is useful for predicting? We don't, the machine learning algorithm needs to figure it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to do the [train-test split](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_sets), that is splitting our dataset in two different parts, one for training and one for testing. If we really want to know whether an algorithm really works, we need to test the algorithm on a dataset that \"has never seen before\". The prediction accuracy over this dataset is going to be considered the final accuracy of the model. It is also obvious that test dataset has to have the exact same format than the training data, so the best way to generate this test data is by splitting the original dataset in two parts. Common percentages for this split are 80%-20% for training and testing respectively. Additionally, the two parts have to be randomly sampled in order to eliminate any possible non-desired effects. The function `train_test_split()` from the machine learning library `sklearn`, is specifically designed to do this task. "

    "The object `X_train` is going to be the input values of our training dataset. As you see above, the inputs are a vector of six elements, with values 0 or 1 depending on whether each specific word appears on each review. The whole object is a $N_{reviews} \\times N_{words}$ matrix, where $N_{reviews}$ is the number of reviews in the training dataset and $N_{words}$ is the number of words used (6 in our case). The `y_train` is the vector for our target variables, that is our sentiment, 0 for negative 1 for positive. The number of elements is equal to $N_{reviews}$. The format of the matrices in the test objects are exactly the same, with the difference that now $N_{reviews}$ indicates the number of elements in the test dataset.\n",

However, the nature of this problem we allows us to perform an even more simple classifier based on a [logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression) that we can use as a benchmark to compare with ANN later on. The `sklearn` library has the function `LogisticRegression(`) that does not need any further operations. `.fit()` will use the training data and `.score()` returns the accuracy over the test datasets."

    "Let's see if we can improve our previous model by using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). As mentioned above, `keras` library is one of the best for using Artificial Neural Networks in Python. Implementing and training them, once we have the training and testing datasets, it is quite simple and few lines of code. There are three steps we identify in the process:\n",
    "1. __Model Definition__: Where we tell keras the specific architecture of the ANN; how many layers, what type of layers, activation functions for the neurons, etc.   \n",
    "2. __Training (fit)__: Once the ANN architecture is defined, we need to tell keras how the ANN will be learning from the training dataset. Here there are also some values that can be defined; l1_ratio, regularisation, etc.\n",
    "3. __Evaluation__: After all parameters of the network are determined, the ANN model is ready for making predictions. In this phase keras will use the test dataset to assess its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first ANN will have a very simple architecture, consisting of a [Sequential model](https://keras.io/guides/sequential_model/) with of only one hidden layer of six neurons and one output layer of one neuron. The corresponding chart of the structure would be the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](ANN_structure.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The input layer consists of six neurons, one for each word, whose values can only be 1 or 0. Thus, the input layer of a review saying *\"I like the product, but the packaging it is awful - it arrived with broken pieces.\"* would be $X_1=0$, $X_2=1$, $X_3=1$, $X_4=0$, $X_5=1$ and $X_6=0$, because it contains the words \"like\", \"awful\" and \"broken\". These values are passed to each of the six neurons in the hidden layer. Each neuron will make an operation using seven weights, one per each link into the neuron plus one for the bias term, then will apply the [ReLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)) activation function and pass the result to the output layer. The neuron in the output layer collects the values of each neuron of the last hidden layer and applies the same operations than the neurons in the hidden layer, the result of it will be the prediction. In this case however, instead of using the ReLU activation function the network uses the [sigmoid function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function). The reason is because of the binary nature of the output. This variable takes values of 0 or 1, so we want function that converts any possible input into these only two possible values. Sigmoid activation functions or step functions are the go-to for binary choices like this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is the main rationale for the structure of the ANN, which is the most difficult part. Now we need to implement these ideas in code. Each type of layer is added into the structure using the `model.add()`. In our current case we only use Dense layers - all neurons connected to all neurons of the previous layer. [Here](https://machinelearningknowledge.ai/different-types-of-keras-layers-explained-for-beginners/) you can find more types of layers you can use and basic explanations. The `model.compile()` function is for selecting the loss functions and metrics, among other things. Because our problem is about guessing a binary choice, setting `loss=binary_crossentropy` and using accuracy for the metrics is a wise decision here. If the ANN was built for solving a regression problem, then other decisions such as `loss=mean_abolute_error` and `metrics=[\"mse\"]` would be better. In [this page](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-choose-loss-functions-when-training-deep-learning-neural-networks/) you have some cases explained."

Remember, as any fitting problem the ration between the data and the number of parameters is something we should keep an eye on. The more data points per parameter, the better. You can see how if we keep adding layers or neurons, the number of parameters to fit quickly escalates. And this is the main reason why Deep Learning always needs large amounts of data.\n",

Although we are not training a very large ANN, there is a lot of calculations to make. As a reference, my laptop took 10-15 seconds. If you see that it takes much longer you might want to consider running this notebook within [Google's Colab](https://colab.research.google.com). "

These reasons lead us to think that there are no signs of overfitting, so we can proceed with the evaluation. Now we are going to make use of the test dataset and compare the accuracy with the training dataset. We can expect lower performance, since the test data has never been seen by our model, but if everything is fine the difference should not be very big. Otherwise would be an alert that something is not right and we should revise our ANN."

    "As we have seen, using only six different words in our dictionary might be limiting the potential of artificial neural networks. They tend to perform better as we increase the number of inputs, so they can detect and use more intricate patterns. However, manually selecting those necessary words can be a bit of a hussle. Fortuntalely, the tokenizer from keras is well equipped for that. It has a function `tokenizer.fit_on_texts()` which allows creating a dictionary of words based on the actual text we want to process. This function sorts the word dictionary by frequency, words that appears more often will be allocated first in the dictionary. When initialising the tokenizer, we can also define the `num_words` parameter that caps the number of words used from the dictonary."

    "Another change we are introducing here is the way we process the sequences after the tokenizer being fit in the text. Rather than counting the occurrence of words in the text, we are going to use directly the sequence vector. This allows to consider further complexities in the natural language. For example, before the subsets \"really like\" and \"don't like\" were difficult to classify. Both have the word like in it but one is clearly positive whereas the other is clearly negative. The tokenizer we have fit has de following words encoded in its dictionary: `{\"like\":38, \"really\":64, \"dont\": 891}` - remember the tokenizer removes the special characters. Thus, the first subset will be converted as the pair `[64,38]` whereas the second as `[891,38]`. The ANN will now be able to distinguish that when the first pair appears in the sequence it will associate a positive sentiment, whereas if it finds the second pair it will associate a negative sentiment. This can increase substantially the performance of our classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one problem to consider though. The lengths of the sequences will vary from one review to the other, but the vector we have to input into the ANN has to be of a fixed size for all reviews. In order to homogenize all these vectors of different lengths, `pad_sequences()` allows keep only the first `maxlen` values and truncate the rest, or if the sequence is shorter, keep all values and fill the rest with zeros. This way all reviews will have the same sequence length.

    "Because we now have integers representing words with different meanings, we also need to add a couple of extra layers in our ANN accounting for this kind of input. Typically in NPL we use an input [Embedding layer](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/understanding-embedding-layer-in-keras-bbe3ff1327ce) that helps to deal with this integer based representation. The first argument in the `layers.Embedding()` is the vocabulary, which in our case we have already define it in the tokenizer. The second argument is the dimension of the layer output, the higher the dimension the more parameters to fit. Finally, `input_length` indicates the length of the vector input, which we have already defined in the `pad_sequence()` function. The Embedding layer output is 2D, so if we want to connect it with the previous ANN structure, we first need to convert it to 1D vector using the `layers.Flatten()`. The rest of the structure remains exactly the same.  "

    "The results now show a very different picture. On one hand we have a testing accuracy that has increased substantially with respect to the previous ANN, and is also higher than the 76.39% of the null model (all predictions are positive). This is great news and a clear sign that using more words and a slightly more complex structure make the Artificial Neural Networks a good model for sentiment analysis. On the other hand, we can appreciate from the plots that our model suffers from overfitting. Thus, the training dataset curve keeps increasing as the epochs go on but the validation dataset saturates after few epochs, it even decreases towards the end. The same conclusion can be drawn looking at the loss functions. This means that the our model is more and more specialising to improve predictions in the training dataset, but at expense of the accuracy in the test data. In fact, we can see how there is 5% difference in the evaluation of train and test datasets. The results are still quite good but it is clear that there is still room for [reducing the overfitting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEMmkFC6IGM) and improving our model."
