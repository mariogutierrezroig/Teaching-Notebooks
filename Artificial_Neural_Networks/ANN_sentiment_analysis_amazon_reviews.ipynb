    "[Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) is revolutionising our world as we know it. Several tasks that we thought not long ago could only be performed by humans, now can be performed by machines faster, in a bigger scale and more accurately. These tasks go from recognising recognising all the objects in millions of images to driving cars without the intervention of any human. Another huge revolution has taken place in the field of computational linguistics thanks to the [Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing). The ability to learn from the humongous corpus of texts produced by humans over centuries and recently digitised, has allowed the creation of [algorithms able to generate text](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-text-generator-gpt-3-learning-language-fitfully/) with an incredible resemblance to human texts, [translate texts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Neural_Machine_Translation) from and to multiple languages, or [virtual assistants and chatbots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant) that we can interact with by just talking to them rather than pressing buttons.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Sentiment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis), part of the NLP, is a contextual mining of text that is able to extract and quantify subjective information. Monitoring online conversations and using sentiment analysis might be useful for businesses that want to understand the social sentiment of their brand or a particular product. The increasing accessibility to online opinions in platforms such as Twitter, Amazon or Tripadvisor has made this tools to be more and more used in marketing departments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we are going to use [Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon Reviews. Basically we will learn how to implement an algorithm that is able to tell whether a review is positive or negative. The task might seem quite simplistic, but if you think for a moment, humans need years of training before being able to speak a language and we cannot simply read and classify millions of reviews in a few minutes. Machines can.\n"

    "The dataset we are going to use in this lab is a collection of reviews and ratings on baby products purchased on Amazon.com. This dataset is part of a Kaggle challenge, so it is publicly available in [this page](https://www.kaggle.com/shyann/amazon-baby-reviews-basics). The format of the data is in a CSV file, which is quite convenient to treat using a `pandas` data frame. Let's first load the dataset and do some exploration."

    "Notice that the 58.33% of the reviews are giving a product 5 starts. Thus, we get a huge unbalance, not only on the reviews per product, but also on the ratings per review. Such kind of effects are quite normal when we analyse real data and we should be aware of it before making any assumptions. This also is quite useful information for setting a baseline model. For example, we know that if we predicted a rating of 5 without considering anything in the review text, we would be correct 58.33% of the time, which is quite a lot. Any machine learning model that is really working should beat that percentage if we want to predict ratings.\n",

    "Discerning from a review what could be a rating of 2 and a rating of 3 can be a difficult task, especially considering this unbalance in the frequency. So, rather than predicting the actual rating we are going to focus on a more simple problem; guessing \"positive\" or \"negative\" sentiment. This will convert our problem from guessing an integer to guessing a binary status. The way we are defining this sentiment it is based on the rating. For ratings with 4 or 5, we are associating a positive sentiment (=1) and for ratings from 1 to 3 we are associating a negative sentiment (=0)."

One can expect that the appearance of some kind of words are related to positive sentiment whereas other kind of words are related to negative sentiment. A common technique in NPL it is just based on that; defining a dictionary of words and count how many times and in which order they appear. The `keras` library for Python has a preprocessing text suit of tools that are specifically design for such tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular open-source software for deep learning is [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), developed and widely used by Google. It is quite complicated to learn programming in TensorFlow from scratch, so the `keras` simplifies our lives substantially by providing standard models and machine learning tools that we can use as functions. I basically acts as the intermediate layer between Python and TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tool we want to use here is called `Tokenizer`. For a given piece of text, the `tokenizer` will first preprocess that text by deleting any special character indicated in `filters`, then converting all capital letters to lower case if `lower=True`, and finally split the text in a list of words by the character we indicate in `split` (which is usually a space). Then it will provide the \"sequences\", or lists of numbers matching the words defined in `work_index` in the order they ocur in the different pieces of text."

The second list is much longer and contains many more occurrences of our 4-word dictionary. Notice that the numbers can be repeated indicating multiple occurrences of the same word.

In this very simple version we will use a selection of 6 different words that we can easily link to positive or negative sentiment: \"love\", \"like\", \"awful\", \"hate\", \"broken\" and \"delay\". In this case we will only check whether the word appears in the review rather than counting how many times it appears. The way to check in Python whether a value `val` is within a list `x` is as easy as `val in x`. This returns a `True` or `False` boolean, but it can be converted to `1` or `0` integers by using the formatting function `int()`.\n",

    "Again, we see the same kind of unbalance toward the positive sentiment. In fact, this something expected and encouraging, because it means that the collection of words used might be a good representation of the reviews. However, there are some nuances to consider. Remember that the tokenizer first splits the reviews into separated words. If there is a review saying \"I really don't like it.\", the word \"like\" appears in it even though the review is clearly negative. This word, as many others, can actually represent both opinions. Then, how do we know it is useful for predicting? We don't, the machine learning algorithm will figure it out.\n",

If we really want to know whether an algorithm really works, we need to test the algorithm on a dataset that \"has never seen before\". The prediction accuracy over this dataset is going to be considered the final accuracy of the model. It is also obvious that test dataset has to have the exact same format than the training data, so the best way to generate this test data is by splitting the original dataset in two parts. Common percentages for this split are 80% for training and 20% for testing. Also, the two parts have to be randomly sampled in order to eliminate any possible non-desired effects. The function `train_test_split()` from the machine learning library `sklearn`, is specifically designed to do this task. "

    "Let's see if we can improve our previous model by using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). As mentioned above `keras` library is one of the best for developing ANNs in Python. Although the concept of ANN might be complicated and understanding them thoroughly can take a lot of time, implementing them once we have the training and testing datasets it is quite simple. The process always follows 3 main steps:\n",
    "1. __Definition__: Here is where we explicitly create the network structure, its layers type and determine the activation functions for each neuron.   \n",
    "2. __Training (fit)__: Once the ANN model is defined, the training phase uses the training dataset to set the best values for all the parameters of the network. Here we can also define some aspects about how the network learns from the data.  \n",
    "3. __Evaluation__: After all parameters of the network are determined, the ANN model is ready for making predictions. In this phase typically we will use the test datasets to get the accuracy of our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first ANN will be very simple, consisting of a [Sequential model](https://keras.io/guides/sequential_model/) with of only one hidden layer of 6 neurons. The corresponding chart of the structure would be the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](ANN_structure.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The input layer consists of six neurons, one for each word, whose values can only be 1 or 0. Thus, the input layer of a review saying *\"I like the product, but the packaging it is awful - it arrived with broken pieces.\"* would be $X_1=0$, $X_2=1$, $X_3=1$, $X_4=0$, $X_5=1$ and $X_6=0$, because it contains the words \"like\", \"awful\" and \"broken\". These values are passed to each of the six neurons on the hidden layer that would make an operation using seven parameters, one per each link into the neuron plus one for the bias term. After this operation the neuron applies the [ReLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)) activation function and passes the result to the output layer. The output layers collects the results of each neuron in the hidden layers and also performs an operation using one parameter per each link plus another for the bias. In this case however, instead of using the ReLU activation function the network uses the [sigmoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function) one. The reason is related to the output. We looking for predicting only one target variable; the sentiment. That is why we only have one neuron in the output layer. This variable is also binary, taking values of 0 or 1, so we want function that converts any possible input into these only two possible values. Sigmoid activation functions are the go-to for binary choices like this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the main rationale for the structure of the ANN, which is the most difficult part. Each type of layer is added into the structure using the `model.add()`. In our current case we only use Dense layers, i.e. all neurons connected to all neurons of the previous layer. [Here](https://machinelearningknowledge.ai/different-types-of-keras-layers-explained-for-beginners/) you can find more types of layers you can use and basic explanations. The `model.compile()` function is for selecting the loss functions and metrics, among other things. Again, our problem is about guessing a binary choice, so setting `loss=binary_crossentropy` and using accuracy for the metrics is a wise decision here. If the ANN was built for solving a regression problem, then other decisions such as `loss=mean_abolute_error` and `metrics=[\"mse\"]` would be better. In [this page](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-choose-loss-functions-when-training-deep-learning-neural-networks/) you have some cases explained."

    "The curves for both accuracy and loss look very convergent and the difference between them is relatively quite small. At the end of the training process the training and validation have very similar values. These reasons lead us to think that there are no signs of overfitting, so we can proceed with the evaluation. Now we are going to make use of the test dataset and compare the accuracy with the training dataset. We can expect some divergence, since the test data has never been seen by our model, but any big difference should sound some alarms."

    "The conclusion is a little bittersweet. Good news are the accuracy between both datasets is very similar, the ANN is working fine. Bad news are that the model is not really improving the performance with respect to the Logistic Regression model (76.89%) or the null case were all predictions are positive sentiment (76.39%). Remember that so far we are only using six words in our dictionary for processing the reviews. The vocabulary to express opinions is much more rich in terms of words used.

    "As we have seen, using only six different words in our dictionary might be limiting the potential of artificial neural networks. They tend to perform better as we increase the number of inputs, so they can detect and use more intricate patterns. However, manually selecting those necessary words can be a bit of a hussle. Fortuntalely, the tokenizer from keras is well equipped for that. It has a function `tokenizer.fit_on_texts()` that allows creating a dictionary of words based on the actual text we want to process. This function orders the word dictionary according to their frequency, words that appears more will be allocated first in the dictionary. When initialising the tokenizer, we can also set a threshold, so that we keep the top `num_words` words in terms of their frequency, the rest will not be indexed and will not appear in the sequences."

    "Another change we are introducing here is the way we process the sequences after the tokenizer being fit in the text. Rather than counting the occurrence of words in the text, we are going to use directly the sequence vector. This allows to consider further complexities in the natural language. For example, before the subsets \"really like\" and \"don't like\" were difficult to classify. Both have the word like in it but one is clearly positive whereas the other is clearly negative. The tokenizer we have fit has de following words encoded in its dictionary: `{\"like\":38, \"really\":64, \"dont\": 891}` - remember the tokenizer removes the special characters. Thus, the first subset will be converted as the pair `[64,38]` whereas the second as `[891,38]`. The ANN will now be able to distinguish that when the first pair appears in the sequence it will associate a positive sentiment, whereas if it finds the second pair it will associate a negative sentiment. This can increase substantially the performance of our classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one problem to consider though. The lengths of the sequences will vary from one review to the other, but the vector we have to input into the ANN has to be of a fixed size for all reviews. In order to homogenize all these vectors of different lengths, `pad_sequences()` allows keep only the first `maxlen` values and truncate the rest, or if the sequence is shorter, keep all values and fill the rest with zeros. This way all reviews will have the same sequence length."

    "Because we now have integers representing words with different meanings, we also need to add a couple of extra layers in our ANN accounting for this kind of input. Typically in NPL we use an input [Embedding layer](https://machinelearningmastery.com/use-word-embedding-layers-deep-learning-keras/) that helps to deal with this integer based representation. The first argument in the `layers.Embedding()` is the vocabulary, which in our case we have already define it in the tokenizer. The second argument is the dimension of the layer output, the higher the dimension the more parameters to fit. Finally, `input_length` indicates the length of the vector input, which we have already defined in the `pad_sequence()` function. The Embedding layer output is 2D, so if we want to connect it with the previous ANN structure, we first need to convert it to 1D vector using the `layers.Flatten()`. The rest of the structure remains exactly the same.  "

    "The results now show a very different picture. On one hand we have a testing accuracy that has increased to 83.33%, substantially higher than the previous 76.90% and also than the 76.39% of the null model (all predictions positive). This is great news and a clear sign that using more words and a slightly more complex structure make the Artificial Neural Networks a good model for sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, we can appreciate from the plots that our model suffers from overfitting. Thus, the training dataset curve keeps increasing as the epochs go on but the validation dataset saturates after few epochs, it even decreases towards the end. The same conclusion can be drawn looking at the loss functions. This means that the our model is more and more specialising to improve predictions in the training dataset, but at expense of the accuracy in the test data. In fact, we can see how there is 5% difference in the evaluation of train and test datasets. The results are still quite good but it is clear that there is still room for [reducing the overfitting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEMmkFC6IGM) and improving our model."
